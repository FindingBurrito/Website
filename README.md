# Front-End Practice Website 🌐

This is a simple website project I created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It’s a personal practice project meant to help me improve my front-end development skills.

## 💡 Project Background

I built this by watching online tutorials, referencing CSS/HTML templates, and getting a little help from ChatGPT along the way. The main goal was to understand how different elements work together to build a functional, interactive webpage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

No frameworks or libraries were used—this is a beginner-friendly, no-database project.

## 🎯 Purpose

This isn’t a full-scale app or original concept. It’s just a hands-on way for me to practice what I’ve been learning in:
- Layout and styling  
- Basic interactivity  
- Structuring clean and readable code

## 🚀 What's Next

As I keep learning, I plan to:
- Improve responsiveness (mobile-friendly design)  
- Add more interactivity using JavaScript  
- Explore tools like GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting  
- Learn how to connect it to a backend in the future
